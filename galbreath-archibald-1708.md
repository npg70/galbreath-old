- [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/LZZ8-6K7) is a huge mess

[^birth]: OPR record of baptism only from [ScotlandsPeople](https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/view-image/nrs_opr_records/2356794?image=104)  30/05/1708 GALBREATH, ARCHIBALD (Old Parish Registers Births 507/ 11 104 Campbeltown) Page 104 of 473. Note record only says "born," but that may actually be a baptism.

[^martha]:  There does not appear to be any record of her birth in the OPR. [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/sources/LZZ8-62H) lists a date 1712 without citation or sources. This would make her 21 when married. There is no citation for that but a reasonable guess. [Find A Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/114485214/martha-galbraith) (retrieved 2021) has a psuedo-entry (there is no actually gravesite), that lists a birth of Campbeltown 13 Aug 1712. However, OPR records on [ScotlandsPeople] on that date show a "Marie White" in Lochgoilhead, Arygll, daugher of John White, mother not recorded. This looks more like wishful thinking.
