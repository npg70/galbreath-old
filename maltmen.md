## Archibald Galbraith, Maltster

From "A List of the Matriculated Members of the Merchants House of Glasgow
From 3rd October, 1768, to 10th June, 1891 : Arranged Alphabetically, in Chronological Order: to which is Appended a List of the Deans of Guild : and Collectors of the House, from the Date of the Letter of Guildry in the Year 1605, to the Present Time"

https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_List_of_the_Matriculated_Members_of_th/csYxAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=galbraith

Lists "Archibald Galbraitth, Maltster, Campbeltown" with two sons admitted to Glasgow Merchant House

* "Galbraith, Arch.", matriculated in 1843, elected 1856 as Director
* "Galbraith, And.", matriculated in 1843, elected 1850 as "Dean of Guild"

I suspect this is [Archibald Galbreath](galbreath-archibald-1760.md), whose son's [Archibald](galbraith-archibald-1807.md) and [Andrew](galbreath-archibald-1760.md), both moved to Glasgow.

Also note this source lists a "James Galbraith, Merchant, Campbeltown" with son  "Galbraith, Archd." admitted in 1870 as "Merchant"

## John Galbraith 

See [John Galbraith](galbraith-john-1809.md)

## Archibald Galbreath, Distiller

> Agnes Galbraith Wallace was born in Ayrshire in 1867, the daughter of a Farmer.
> In 1889, she married James Greenlees in Campbeltown.
> James and his brother, William, were distillers and co-owners of
> Longrow Distillery. In 1912, William bought 100 shares and Agnes
