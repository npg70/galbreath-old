***Archibald Galbraith***, son of Donald Galbraith and Isabella McDermid, was born Campbeltown 1 July 1865[^birth],
and died 29 Nov 1949, and buried at Kilkerran Graveyard.[^burial]

He married at Greenock on 15 Jul 1809[^marriage] to **Margaret Robertson**, died 22 Apr 1950.[^burial]

Notes on parents: Married 1858 in Campbeltown: https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/view-image/nrs_stat_marriages/1855646?return_row=0, donald age 25, isabella age 19.  I would suspect there are more children.


[^birth]: Statuatory Records of Campbeltown, Argyll; 1865 GALBRAITH, ARCHIBALD (Statutory registers Births 507/ 143); [ScotlandsPeople](https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/view-image/nrs_stat_births/39836164).  Record states "Daniel Galbraith" is the father but I think this is an error and should be "Donald"

[^burial]: FindAGrave is misindexed and says the name is "Alexander".

[^marriage]: need to look up again... record gives no extra biographical info.
