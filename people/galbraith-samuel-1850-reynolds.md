***Samuel Galbraith***, son of *[Archibald Galbreath](galbreath-archibald-1803.md)* and *Margaret Loynachan*,
was perhaps born in Ugadale in 17 Nov 1850.

He married **Mary Ellen Reynolds**

His middle name is often listed as "Templeton" but this may be being confused with his son "Samuel Templeton Galbraith", b. XXX.

The birth date of "17 Nov" is often used but without source.

His baptism is not listed in the the OPR records, and there doesn't appear to be a gap in the Campbeltown records.

Sometimes listed as being born in 1856, but what would be problematic since 

1. he is not listed in any records
2. the Census of 1851 lists a Samuel age 0
3. the Census of 1861 lists a Samuel age 9.

So 1850 (or 1851) does seem the most likely birth year.
