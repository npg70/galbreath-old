**John Galbreath**, son of [*James Galbreath*](galbreath-james-1659.md) and *Mary Nielson*, was born at Kilkeddan, Argyll, Scotland 29 May 1680 and baptized at Campbeltown 30 May 1680.[^birth] His death is not recorded. He married, at first, Campbeltown 16 Mar 1707, **Mary Mitchell**;[^marriage1] and second, at Campbeltown abt. 1728 to **Katherine McCallum**.[^marriage2]

The origins of *Mary Mitchell* are not clear.

- The most likely is that is the daughter of John Mitchell and Margaret Todd, born Glasgow 24 Jan 1684.[^maybemary2]
- Some claim she is the daughter of Archibald Mitchell and Mary Armour born Campbeltown 9 Dec 1676.[^maybetmary1].
- Another claim she is a twin, but I've found no evidence of that, and maybe confusion with her children John and Mary.
