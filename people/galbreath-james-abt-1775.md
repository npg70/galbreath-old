[^census-1841]: 1841 UK Census; Long Row, Campbeltown, Argyllshire, Scotland; household of Martha Galbraith, from [FindMyPast](https://www.findmypast.com/transcript?id=GBC/1841/0016601102). Only Martha (age 60), and daughter Mary (age 20) listed. Martha's age is listed as 60, but given the rounding down of ages in the 1841 census, her birth year could be 1776-1781.  Both are being born in "Argyllshire"
