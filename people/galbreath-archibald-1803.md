***Archibald Galbreath***, son of *[James Galbreath](galbreath-james-abt-1775.md)* and *Martha Galbreath*, born 8 Sep 1803, Skerbolin Farm, Campbeltown, Argyll, Scotland and then baptized  11 Sep 1803, Campbeltown, Argyll, Scotland [^birth].  He died 17 Feb 1885.[^death]

He married first at Campbeltown 5 Mar 1835[^marriage1] to **Eugina McCallum**.  Since he remarried 2 years later, it likely she died in 1838 or 1839, perhaps to complications of giving birth of her last child, _Eugina_.  It appears the Eugina was taken in by a McCallum family in Gigha, although the exact relationship is unclear.[^census1841-eugina].

He married second at Campbeltown 25 Aug 1840[^marriage2] to **Margaret Loynachan**, born 24 Aug 1821, South End, Argyll, Scotland,  daughter of Neil Loynachan.  She died 14 Nov 1886.

The 1841 and 1851 census listed him as farmer[^census1841][^census1851], however there after until his death he was  _flesher_ or butcher.[^census1861][^census1871][^census1881][^james-death]
