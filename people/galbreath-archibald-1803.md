***Archibald Galbreath***, son of *[James Galbreath](galbreath-james-abt-1775.md)* and *Martha Galbreath*, born 8 Sep 1803, Skerbolin Farm, Campbeltown, Argyll, Scotland and then baptized 11 Sep 1803[^birth] and died 17 Feb 1885.[^death] both in Campbeltown, Argyll, Scotland.

He married first at Kilcalconell 28 Feb 1835[^marriage1a] (and again at Campbeltown 5 Mar 1835[^marriage1b]) to **Eugina McCallum**.  Little is known about her origins except that she was from Kilcalconnel and her father John was a Tacksman in the area.[^marriage1a]  Since Archibald remarried 2 years later, it likely she died in 1838 or 1839, perhaps to complications of giving birth of her last child, _Eugina_.  It appears the child Eugina was taken in by a McCallum family in Gigha, although the exact relationship is unclear.[^census1841-eugina].

He married second at Southend 25 Aug 1839[^marriage2a] (with a second ceremony a year later at Campbeltown 25 Aug 1840[^marriage2b]) to **Margaret Loynachan**, born 24 Aug 1821, South End, Argyll, Scotland, daughter of Neil Loynachan farmer and Margaret Brodie. She died at Dumbarton, 14 Nov 1886.[^loynachan-death]

His marrage to Eugina listed him as a Tacksman in Skerbolin.[^marriage1a] The 1841 and 1851 census listed him as farmer[^census1841][^census1851], however there after until his death he was  _flesher_ or butcher.[^census1861][^census1871][^census1881][^james-death]
