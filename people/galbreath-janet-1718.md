***Janet Galbreath***, of unknown parents, was born about 1718.  She married Campbeltown 1 Jul 1744[^marriage] to **Robert McNair**, bp. 5 Jan 1718 of *James McNair* and *Mary Picken*.

THere is some confusion on Janet's origins.  Some claim she is [*Janet Galbreath*](galbreath-janet-1711.md), born 1711 daugher of X and Y. While certainly not impossible, this would mean Robert married someone 7 years older than him, and that Janet had her first child when she was 35 and the last at age 47. In addition, there is a good match for Janet b. 1711 to be married in 1735 to David Ryburn, born 1702.  Here she would have have first child at 25 and last at age 36.

Childern of Robert and Janet (Galbreath) McNair, all baptised in Campbeltown:
