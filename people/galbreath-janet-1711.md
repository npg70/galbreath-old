***Janet Galbreath***, daughter of *[John Galbreath](galbreath-john-1680.md)* and *Mary Mitchell* born Campbeltown, Argyll, Scotland 14 Oct 1711.

Unfortunately there are two Janets at the time and can't tell which is which.

Janet 1 married 22 Feb 1735[^ryburn-marriage] to **David Ryburn**. This Janet died in 1758.  Here Janet would have married at age 24, had first child at age 25, and last child at 36.  Seems appropriate (but clearly not proof).  As for David there are two choices.  One being born 15 Feb 1702[^ryburn-david], son of *Matthew Ryburn*, *Elizabeth _____*.    The other would John Ryburn and Jane Sheddon. TBD.

4. *Arthur Ryburn*, bp. 4 Jun 1743
5. *Mary Ryburn*, bp. 3 Jan 1746

Janet 2 married 15 Mar 1731[^campbell-marriage] to Robert Campbell bp 29 July 1711, son of **Robert Campbell** and Janet Templeton.  Here Janet would be 20 when she married, and first child at 21.  A bit young but not unreasonable.
