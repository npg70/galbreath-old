***Eugina Galbraith***, daughter of *[Archibald Galbreath](galbreath-archibald-1803.md)* and
*[Janet "Eugina" McCallum](mccallum-janet-eugina-1815-galbreath.md)*, was baptized at Campbeltown 25 Jan 1838.[^birth]
She died at Clachan 5 Oct 1920[^death] and buried at Kilchattan Old Graveyard in Gigha[^burial].

She married 24 Apr 1866[^marriage] to **James Wotherspoon**.  The record lists her mother (who she never met) as "Jane McCallum", and not "Eugina".

Her mother likely died due to complications of childbirth, and her father gave the baby the William McCallum hosuehold in Gigha.[^census1841]  The 1841 Census lists the McCallum family and a lone 3 year-old Eugina.

The 1851 Census, lists Eugina (age 13, b. 1838, from "Kirkcuslen"  TBD need to review original document) as being the neice of William McCallum (age 32, b 1819 in "Kilcolmkill"  Need to see original but likely Kilcalmonell) in Ardlamy, Gigha.[^census1851].

In 1861, Eugina's older sister Martha joined the household,[^census1861].  The records lists Martha and Eugina has both being from Campbeltown, and William McCallum being born at Kilcalmonell in 1819.  Unfortunately the 1861 does not indicate the relationship between them.

Recalling that her marriage listed her as being from Kilcalmonell and her father's name is John.
