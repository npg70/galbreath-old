***Orsla Galbreath***, daughter of [Patrick Galbreath](galbreath-patrick-1712.md) and *Jean Watson*,
baptized 22 Sep 1745 in Campbeltown[^orsla-birth].

She married 22 Dec 1772 in Campbeltown[^orsla-marriage] to **Archibald Galbreath**, perhaps son of [James Galbreath](galbreath-james-1713.md) and Margaret Adam, born in 1743.

Unfortunately most data is circumstantial
* The marriage record provide no additional details
* The baptism records of the children provide no biographical or geographical details. 
* The children appeared to have died before 1855 as they do not appear in civil records.
* No one appears in the [1792 Census](/sources/list-of-inhabitants-upon-the-duke-of-argylls-property-in-kintyre-1792.md)
* No one in 1841 Census
* No one in 1851 Census
* No markers found on Find A Grave.
