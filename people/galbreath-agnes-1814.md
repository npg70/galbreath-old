"Agnes Cook, married to James Cook fisherman.  1869 Dec 10 11pm New Quay Head Campbeltown.  Female, Age 56 [1813].  Father: Neil Galbraith Fisherman, Margt McMillian.  Present: William Cook, son".  It would appear the son William got the name of his grandfather wrong (should be _Archibald_ not _Neil_), or I'm misreading the script.  For reference, there was a Anne Galbreath born 1811 of Neill Galbreath and Mary McMillian([ScotlandsPeople]https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/record-results?search_type=people&event=%28B%20OR%20C%20OR%20S%29&record_type%5B0%5D=opr_births&church_type=Old%20Parish%20Registers&dl_cat=church&dl_rec=church-births-baptisms&surname=Galbreath&surname_so=syn&forename=Anne&forename_so=starts&sex=F&from_year=1811&to_year=1811&parent_names_so=exact&parent_name_two=mary%20mcmillan&parent_name_two_so=fuzzy&county=ARGYLL&record=Church%20of%20Scotland%20%28old%20parish%20registers%29%20Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20Other%20churches))
