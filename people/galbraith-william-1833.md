> OUTRAGE AT CAMPBELTOWN.
> 
> On Tuesday night, little after eleven o’clock, smoke was observed the shop of William Galbraith, watchmaker and jeweller, Reform Square, Campbeltown.
> On the door, which was found open, being pushed up, it was seen that the fire was making rapid progress.
> The first person to enter the shop discovered Mr. Galbraith, the proprietor, lying on floor moaning and crying out, 
> “I'm stabbed; I’m stabbed.” Mr. Galbraith having been removed to a house near, Dr. Cunningham, who was called in, 
> found that rather serious wound, abont three-quarters of inch deep, had been inflicted upon his left breast, a little 
> above the heart, with several other wounds of less a serious nature. Reports regarding the cause the fire and the attack
> on Mr. Galbraith are very conflicting. One account says that he went home eleven o’clock usual. Finding that had left his
> pocket-book with some money in his shop, he, while the way back, was watched by some men, who followed him to the shop.
> After he had secured the pocket-book he was knocked down by a blow on the forehead and afterwards stabbed. Another account,
> which is more trustworthy, is that while Mr. Galbraith was going home, between ten and eleven o’clock, he
> observed light in his shop, and on opening the door to see the cause was a truck with a life-preserver and
> rendered insensible. Some time afterwards discovered that he had been stabbed in the breast and that ths premises
> were in flames. Mr. Galbraith is in a very precarious state. The affair has caused great sensation in Campbeltown. 
> An empty pocket book which belonged to Mr. Galbraith, and said contained between £35 and £40, has been found in a
> woodyard about hundred yards from the scene of the outrage.
