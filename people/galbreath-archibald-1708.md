**Archibald Galbreath**, son of [*John Galbreath*](galbreath-john-1680.md) and *Mary Mitchell*, born Campeltown, Argyll, Scotland 30 May 1708[^birth] and passed in Campbeltown Sep 1789, buried in Kilchousland Graveyard, Campbeltown.[^death]

He married in Campbeltown 1 Apr 1733, **Martha White**,[^marriage] born say 1712.[^martha]

The bpatism records, the marriage records for Archibald and all of his children do not contain any extra biographical or geographic information.  The tombstone as Ardnacross and given he was the eldest son, he likely was in the Kilkeddan area.  The tombstone matches this saying he was from Ardnacross.

All records contain no extra biographical or geographic information.

[^martha]:  There does not appear to be any record of her birth in the OPR. [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/sources/LZZ8-62H) lists a date 1712 without citation or sources. This would make her 21 when married. There is no citation for that but it is a reasonable guess. [Find A Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/114485214/martha-galbraith) (retrieved 2021) has a psuedo-entry (there is no actually gravesite), that lists a birth of Campbeltown 13 Aug 1712. However, OPR records on [ScotlandsPeople] on that date show a "Marie White" in Lochgoilhead, Arygll, daugher of John White, mother not recorded. This looks more like wishful thinking.
