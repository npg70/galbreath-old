[^martha]:  There does not appear to be any record of her birth in the OPR. [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/sources/LZZ8-62H) lists a date 1712 without citation or sources. This would make her 21 when married. There is no citation for that but it is a reasonable guess. [Find A Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/114485214/martha-galbraith) (retrieved 2021) has a psuedo-entry (there is no actually gravesite), that lists a birth of Campbeltown 13 Aug 1712. However, OPR records on [ScotlandsPeople] on that date show a "Marie White" in Lochgoilhead, Arygll, daugher of John White, mother not recorded. This looks more like wishful thinking.
