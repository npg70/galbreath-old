**Robert Galbreath**, son of [*Samuel Galbreath*](galbreath-samuel-1736.md) and *Janet McNair*, born in Peninver, Argyll, Scotland 12 Oct 1778, baptized Campbeltown, Argyll, Scotland 15 Oct 1778,[^birth] died Neville, Clermont, Ohio, USA 19 May 1847.

He married at Campbeltown 18 Apr 1805, **Katherine Harvie**, daugher of *James Harvie* and [*Katherine Galbreath*](galbreath-katharine-1741.md), born 29 Jul 1780 and baptized at Campbeltown 30 Jul 1780,[^birth-kh] died Washington Township, Clermont, Ohio, USA 21 Jun 1847.

Based on the baptism records of the first two children[^jane-birth][^samuel-birth], it appears as a young man, he moved to Dalintober to work as a malt-man (1806), but after his father died (1807), he returned to take over the family farm in Peninver (1808).

In 1817, the entire family, including the 5 month-old Archibald, immigrated to Clermont County, Ohio:[^redtower-16-54]

> Robert, Catherine and their young family departed Panever, Scotland on July 24, 1817, and arrived in
> Baltimore, MD on Sept 26, 1817. The family came across country to Pittsburgh, PA with oxen and cart, then
> down the Ohio River by flat boat to settle near Neville, Cleremont[sic] Co, Ohio where Robert took up farming.

It is unclear what triggered this.  TBD: Perhaps he sold the farm to his younger sister [Catherine](galbreath-catherine-1788.md) (who married James Greenlees)?

And why Clermont, Ohio?  TBD: McNair connection.

The date of entry at the Port of Baltimore has not been confirmed since:
* Baltimore did not keep records of immigration until much later
* Earlier commercial records are indexed by boat name, not date.  And these records on not online.
