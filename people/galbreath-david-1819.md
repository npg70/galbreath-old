***David Galbreath***, origin TBD, was born say 1819.

He married, as a fisherman, at Campbeltown 3 Sep 1844 to Catharine McKinnon, "daughter of late John McKinnon, seaman."[^marriage]

Given the lack of statuatory death records, it's possible he died before 1855.  The death record of his son Robert in 1885 indicates he was deceased by then.
