***David Galbreath***, son of Alexander Galbreath and Merran Galbreath, was bapitized in Gigha 3 Feb 1812.[^birth] He likely died between 1851 and 1855 since he is present in the 1851 census[^census1851] but there are no statutory records of death which started in 1855.  The death record of his son Robert in 1885 indicates he was deceased by then.

He married, as a fisherman, at Campbeltown 3 Sep 1844 to **Catharine McKinnon**, "daughter of late John McKinnon, seaman."[^marriage]

Maybe 1841 Census: South Drimcrow, Gigha https://www.findmypast.com/transcript?id=GBC%2F1841%2F0016661129  has the only david in Gigha.  Also has ALexander (father) at age 60 / ~1781, and Marion age 20 / ~ 1821, and some grandchild? Alex age 5 / 1836.   Ages are all rounded to nearest 5 so who knows.

Multiple Merrans died in the 1830, with birth in 1780s so this could be ok.
