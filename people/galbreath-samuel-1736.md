**Samuel Galbreath**, son of [*Archibald Galbreath*](galbreath-archibald-1708.md) and *Martha White*, baptized Campbeltown 4 Feb 1736.[^birth] He married at Peninver, Argyll, Scotland 1774,[^marriage] and died Peninver 1807.[^death] **Janet McNair**, baptized Campbeltown 12 Oct 1755,[^janet] daughter of *Robert McNair* and [Janet Galbreath](galbreath-janet-1718.md). Her death is not recorded.[^janet-death]

The entire family is listed in the Duke of Argyll's 1792 census as living in Peninver.[^1792]  In particular, a daughter Janet is listed but there is no record of her in the Old Parish Records.

Given the late marriage of Samuel and Janet there is the possibility he had an earlier wife and family.  There is no evidence of such however.

Of note there is another [Samuel Galbreath](galbreath-samuel-1765.md) and lived in Campbeltown proper.

[^janet-death]: Interestingly, no mention is made of a spouse in the testament of Samuel Galbreath, which may mean she passed before 1807. [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/LVX6-RKP) circa 2021, lists a date of 07 Jul 1831 without citation.  OPR records indicate a Janet Galbreath did pass at Glasgow 24 Jul 1831, which can't be the same Janet.
