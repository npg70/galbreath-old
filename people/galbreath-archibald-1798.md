title: Archibald Galbreath b. ~1798 m. Margaret McMillian
---
**Archibald Galbreath**, of unknown origin, married at Campbeltown, Arygll, Scottland 16 Feb 1813 to **Margaret McMillian**, baptised at Campbeltown 25 Oct 1791,[^margaret] daughter of *Neil McMillian*, b. 1750 and *Margaret Mceachine*, born at Campbeltown 9 Jan 1769.

Archibald was a sailor[^ann] and fisherman[^john].

There does exist an 1841 Census record of Archibald and Margaret Galbreath[^1841] (and only them, no children are listed).  It gives an estimated birth year of 1781 for both of them, and gives his occupation as "fisher."  The two children we know who got married, did so before 1841, so this seems possible.

Other than that, the interweb gives various accounts of the Archibald Galbreath who married Margaret McMillian:

- [example1](https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/person/tree/168792408/person/302189590160/facts), [example2](https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/person/tree/159257411/person/272096895326/facts) b. 1790, child of David Galbraith b. 1761 and Margaret Baird b. 1742.  Might be referring to [David Galbreath b. abt 1720](galbreath-david-abt-1720.md), who married Martha Baird b. 1727? No records of an Archibald, and unlikely she had a child at age 48. Numerous examples claim Archibald died in 1869 Dungannon, Tyrone, Northern Ireland.  An in the example the great picture of David Galbreath is actually for [different person](https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/person/tree/54711808/person/13702841868/facts) (David of Paisley, m. Jean Whitehill/Whitehead)
- [example](https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/person/tree/47214813/person/6745410623/facts): b. 1798, child of David Galbraith b. 1755 and Mary Fleming b. 1765. Dates referred to [David Galbreath](galbreath-david-1755.md).  However it would mean Archibald was 15 when married.  Unlikley.

Oddly speciifc, but can't find birth or marriage records.

Interesting, attributed to a little known Archibald that died in infancy instead of the later one born in 1783. The later Archibald is a good canidate: age appropriate (only 8 years older) than Margaret (assuming her birth is correct). One problem, some [other](https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/person/tree/28530647/person/332054882446/facts) [trees](https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/person/tree/153785869/person/372034170104/facts) claim this Archibald moved to Gigha in 1800, and had a son Malcolm in 1803. However this seems suspect to me.

Children of Archibald and Margaret (McMillian) Galbreath.  Note that two children married into the same *Cook* family.
