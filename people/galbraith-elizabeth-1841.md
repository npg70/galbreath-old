***Elizabeth Galbraith***, daughter of *[John Galbraith](galbraith-john-1809.md)* and *Mary Colville McEwing*,
born 25 APR 1841, baptized 10 MAY 1841,[^birth] and died 10 January 1931,[^death] all in Campbeltown.

She married in 1859 to **James Nicol Fleming** TBD Vitals.  He was director at the City of Glasgow Bank, which collpased in 1878.   He was convicted of fraud, served 8 months in prison, and died in Campbeltown in 1904.

* 1878 - rumoured to have fled to Spain.
* 1882 - Convicted
* 1904 - Died

After his conviction, there were issue with him improving the house that was in trust for wife, using effectively stolen monies.[^casemine]

Interestingly, there was also a ship "James Nicol Fleming", launched in 1869.  The ships owner was Albion Shipping, owned by James Galbraith of Glasgow[^clyde1].  In 1879, the name was changed to "Napier" (also a name related to the Galbraiths). 

Prior to this James Galbraith, launched the ship "Margaret Galbraith" in 1868,[^clyde2] named after this wife.

Just a conciendence that Fleming's wife was a Galbraith, and the Galbraith shipbuilder named his ship after Fleming?  I assumed Fleming approved the loan for the ship.
