***Hugh Galbreath***, of unknown origin, was born around 1785.  He died before 1841.

He married 1807 in Campbeltown[^marriage] to **Christina (Christian) McDonald**, was daughter of Norman MacDonald and Mary Beeth, baptized 	
08/02/1788 in Campbeltown[^mcdonald-birth]. Her death is not listed in statutory records indicating she died before 1855.
She is also not in the 1851 Census, so perhaps died before that.

Much of family, minus Hugh, is listed in the 1841 Census.[^census1841]
