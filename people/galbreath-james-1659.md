Children of James and Mary (Nielson) Galbreath, all baptized in Campbeltown:[^children]

1. [*James Galbreath*](galbreath-james-1672.md), bp. 25 Aug 1672;[^birth-james] m. *Mary Fleming*.
2. *Patrick Galbraith*, bp. 28 Oct 1674, Kilkeddan, Argyll, Scotland.[^birth-patrick] Possibly married *Bessie Watson* on 4 Jan 1700, recorded under "Cabreth." But no record of any children.
3. [*Archibald Galbreath*](galbreath-archibald-1678.md), bp. 17 Jul 1678,[^birth-archibald] m. *Elizabeth Johns*.
4. [*John Galbreath*](galbreath-john-1680.md), bp. 30 May 1680;[^birth-john] m. *Mary Mitchell*.
5. *Matthew Galbreath*, bp. 15 Mar 1691,[^birth-matthew] d. 1760? (unsourced).

[^birth]: The 1650 is a best guess. There is a record of a [James Galbreath](https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/view-image/nrs_opr_records/2356839?image=6&return_row=0) being baptized in 1659, son of Archibald Galbreath and Margaret Johnstone. Assuming that is close to birth, that would mean he married and had children at age 13. It's possible it was a late baptism done when the parents moved into the area, however this is just speculation. 

[^mary]: Again, birth of 1650 is an estimate.
