[^janet-death]: Interestingly, no mention is made of spouse in the testament of Samuel Galbreath, which may mean she passed before 1807.  [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/LVX6-RKP) circa 2021, lists a date of 07 Jul 1831 with out citation.  OPR records indicate a Janet Galbreath did pass at Glasgow 24 Jul 1831, which can't be the same Janet.
