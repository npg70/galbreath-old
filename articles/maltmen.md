re: Ryburn family

> Jean (1709), Janet (1712), Elizabeth (1715) and Mathew (1716).
> Again, none of the children may have died young, as no names are repeated.

> David died in 1776, leaving a three-page testament dative (see www.scotlandspeople.com)

## Archibald Galbraith, Maltster

From "A List of the Matriculated Members of the Merchants House of Glasgow
From 3rd October, 1768, to 10th June, 1891 : Arranged Alphabetically, in Chronological Order: to which is Appended a List of the Deans of Guild : and Collectors of the House, from the Date of the Letter of Guildry in the Year 1605, to the Present Time"

https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_List_of_the_Matriculated_Members_of_th/csYxAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=galbraith

Lists "Archibald Galbraitth, Maltster, Campbeltown" with two sons admitted to Glasgow Merchant House

* "Galbraith, Arch.", matriculated in 1843, elected 1856 as Director
* "Galbraith, And.", matriculated in 1843, elected 1850 as "Dean of Guild"

I suspect this is [Archibald Galbreath](galbreath-archibald-1760.md), whose son's [Archibald](galbraith-archibald-1807.md) and [Andrew](galbreath-archibald-1760.md), both moved to Glasgow.

Also note this source lists a "James Galbraith, Merchant, Campbeltown" with son  "Galbraith, Archd." admitted in 1870 as "Merchant"

## John Galbraith 

See [John Galbraith](galbraith-john-1809.md)

Provost of Campbeltown, Founded Scotia Distillery in 1832? 

## Archibald Galbreath, Distiller

Living 1797.  Should be listed in 1792 census.

## Archibald Galbreath 1806 brewer

## Agnes Galbraith Wallace 1867

TODO: find her parents or grandparents to see which Galbraith/Galbreath

https://www.campbeltownpicturehouse.co.uk/2017/11/whisky-war-and-provost-greenlees/

> Agnes Galbraith Wallace was born in Ayrshire in 1867, the daughter of a Farmer.
> In 1889, she married James Greenlees in Campbeltown.
> James and his brother, William, were distillers and co-owners of
> Longrow Distillery. In 1912, William bought 100 shares and Agnes
> bought 50 shares in the Picture House. I thought it strange that
> James didn’t buy any shares but then I looked a bit closer at the list of original shareholder names.
>
> Agnes and James Greenlees had four sons, John, Robert Wallace, William and James. 
> Two hundred shares were purchased in 1912, with the boys being named as the shareholders.
