title: Clermont Notes
---

We know Robert "Lawful" G came to clermon in 1818.  But why?  here's notes.

Samuel Gilbreath 
 - is listed in 1811-1839 tax records for Clermont.
 - maybe opened first store in Batavia? "In summer 1814, Samuel Gilbreath opened the first store in town near the fording place." (https://bataviatownship.org/history.html)
 - Maybe here: https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/collaborate/GXZ1-9C3
 - Maybe son Samuel? https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/99F7-JNR
 - Unlikely to be connected to Kintyre... suspect it's a different line.

1814 clermont tax records have a number of Harvey/Harvie/Harvy records.
