# Galbreath Geneaology

Currently focused on Campbeltown, Argyll, Scotland in the 1700s and 1800s, and descendants of Robert Galbreath b. 1778 who immigrated to Clermont County, Ohio in 1818.

## Descendants of James Galbreath and Mary Nielson

The descendants of [James Galbreath](galbreath-james-1659.md) b. 1659 and Mary Nielson had multiple immigrants to United States.

* [Alexander Galbreath](galbreath-alexander-1753.md), b. 1753, immigrated to Baltimore, then York County, PA in 1785.

## Descendants of William Galbreath and Margaret Dunlop of Campbeltown

The children and grandchildren of [William Galbreath](/galbreath-william-1736.md) and Margaret Dunlop were influential in government and industry in Campbeltown and Glasgow.  

The rumour is that William somehow a descendant of [Archibald Galbreath](galbreath-archibald-1708.md) of the previous line. It appears there are no direct-male descendants, so it may remain a mystery. 

## Archibald Galbreath and Margaret McMillian

The parents of [Archibald Galbreath](https://github.com/npg70/galbreath/blob/main/galbreath-archibald-1798.md), who married *Margaret McMillian*, is not clear.  There are at least four different stories for who the parents are.

## Samuel Galbreath and Janet Langwill

Both common names, and families have intermarried before, but Samuel's parents are unknown.  See [Samuel Galbreath](galbreath-samuel-1765.md) for details.

## Lineage of Alexander Galbreath

[Alexander Galbreath](galbreath-alexander-1816.md), a "malt man" emmigrated from Kintrye in the 1850s to West Virgina and Ohio. However, his parents are a mystery.

## Lineage of John Galbreath and Isobell Clark

The parents of [John Galbreath](galbreath-john-abt-1710.md) who married Isobell Clark in 1732 is not clear. Public sources seem to think there were TWO John Galbreath and Isobell Clarks, although I can't find any evidence of such.  Of the 15 (!) children, only the last one John b. 1760 seems to have any records.

## Lineage of James Galbreath and Martha Galbreath

See [James Galbreath](galbreath-james-abt-1775.md), b. say 1775,  marries *Martha Galbreath*. All marriage and children records reference both having the name Galbreath. So...

## Lineage of David Galbreath and Martha Baird

[David Galbreath](galbreath-david-abt-1720.md), b. say 1720, who married *Martha Baird*.  His parents are unclear, and all children seem to have no additional records.
