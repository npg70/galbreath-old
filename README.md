# Galbreath Geneaology

Currently focused on Campbeltown, Argyll, Scotland in the 1700s and 1800s, and descendants of Robert Galbreath b. 1778 who immigrated to Clermont County, Ohio in 1818.

## Descendants of James Galbreath and Mary Nielson

The descendants of [James Galbreath](/people/galbreath-james-1659.md) b. 1659 and Mary Nielson had multiple immigrants to United States.

* [Alexander Galbreath](/people/galbreath-alexander-1753.md), b. 1753, immigrated to Baltimore, then York County, PA in 1785.
* [Robert Galbreath](/people/galbreath-robert-1778.md) b. 1778 immigrated to Clermont County, Ohio, USA in 1818

## Descendants of William Galbreath and Margaret Dunlop of Campbeltown

The children and grandchildren of [William Galbreath](/people/galbreath-william-1736.md) and Margaret Dunlop were influential in government and industry in Campbeltown and Glasgow.  

* *[Andrew Galbraith](/people/galbraith-andrew-1799.md)*, b. 10 Feb 1799, m. *Margaret Bogle Scott*. Lord Provost of Glasgow 1857-60
* *[John Galbraith](/people/galbraith-john-1809.md)*, b. 1809, Provost of Campbeltown and founder of Scotia Distillery.

The rumour is that William somehow a descendant of [Archibald Galbreath](/people/galbreath-archibald-1708.md) of the previous line. It appears there are no direct-male descendants, so it may remain a mystery. 

## Archibald Galbreath and Margaret McMillian

The parents of [Archibald Galbreath](/people/galbreath-archibald-1798.md), who married *Margaret McMillian*, is not clear.  There are at least four different stories for who the parents are.

## Samuel Galbreath / Janet Langwill

Both common names, and families have intermarried before, but Samuel's parents are unknown.  See [Samuel Galbreath](/people/galbreath-samuel-1765.md) for details.

## Alexander Galbreath / Elisabeth McCualskey

[Alexander Galbreath](/people/galbreath-alexander-1816.md), a "malt man" emmigrated from Kintrye in the 1850s to West Virgina and Ohio. However, his parents are a mystery.

## John Galbreath / Mary McTaggart 

[John Galbreath](/people/galbreath-john-1815.md) was born around 1814 in Clachan / Kilcalmonel and moved to Campbeltown and started a family with Mary McTaggart. However no good records seem to confirm his birth.

## Lineage of David Galbreath b. 1684 and Isabella Watson

[David Galbreath](/people/galbreath-david-1684.md) is of unknown origin.

## Lineage of John Galbreath and Isobell Clark

The parents of [John Galbreath](/people/galbreath-john-abt-1710.md) who married Isobell Clark in 1732 is not clear. Public sources seem to think there were TWO John Galbreath and Isobell Clarks, although I can't find any evidence of such.  Of the 15 (!) children, only the last one John b. 1760 seems to have any records.

## Lineage of David Galbreath b. ~1720 and Martha Baird

[David Galbreath](/people/galbreath-david-abt-1720.md), b. say 1720, who married *Martha Baird*.  His parents are unclear, and all children seem to have no additional records.

## Lineage of James Galbreath b. ~1775 and Martha Galbreath

See [James Galbreath](/people/galbreath-james-abt-1775.md), b. say 1775,  marries *Martha Galbreath*. All marriage and children records reference both having the name Galbreath. So...

## Lineage of David Stewart Galbraith, Esq.

[David Stewart Galbraith, Esq.](/people/galbraith-david-stewart-1782.md) perhaps owned a number of lands in Argyll.  He became lawyer and presented at many Kirk Sessions in Campbeltown.  He had many children in Campbeltown.  However they all drifted away, and I don't believe there any direct male descendants left.

## Patrick Galbreath / Jean Watson

TBD [Patrick Galbreath](/people/galbreath-patrick-1712.md) and Jean Watson had six children, but unclear who he is and no records about children.

## Lachlan Galbraith, Ferryman

## Family of Archibald Galbreath and Jean Black
