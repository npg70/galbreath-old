## Page 19

[Mary Galbreath](/people/galbreath-mary-1788.md) b. 1788. is mentioned as the great grandmother of Mary Clark who died at age 2 on 7 Feb 1913.  It ends with:

> This stone is one of three, side by side, to the members of the Clark farming family,
> which descends through Robert Clark and Mary Galbraith, and Robert Clark and
> Catherine McNair (married 1861), who were the parents of the tragic Mary's father,
> Robert, who married Isabella Watson 4/8/1899. As the inscription records, Isabella
> died on 18/6/1923, at the age of 52, and Robert on 5/3/1955 at the age of 93.

Using Find-a-Grave we see two stones:

- Robert Clark and Isabella Watson, and their daughter Mary: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/180602584/mary-clark
- Robert Clark and Catherine McNair: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/133281357/robert-clark

But not the third stone with Robert Clark and Mary Galbraith.  Humph.

## Page 27

Agnes Galbraith is mentioned:

> This sandstone momument, which is eroding badly, was raised by Malcolm McNeilage to
> his wife Agnes Galbraith, who died of tuberculosis at age 23 on 28/10/1886.

There are some other minor details in the book, but her parents are unknown.
