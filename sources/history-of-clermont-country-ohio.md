McNair and Argylshire reference:

> Monroe Township
>
> Of the settlements made at a later day, the one so favor-
> ably known as " the Scotch settlement" is the most prom-
> inent. In 1821, John Porter, Alexander Porter, Janet Johnston, John Johnston, and John McNair, natives of Argyleshire, Scotland, landed at Philadelphia, and crossing the mountains, purchased a flat-boat at Pittsburgh, de-
> scended the river to Neville, where they temporarily lived.
> In 1823 they settled just north of Nicholsville, where one of the party, Alex. Porter, yet resides, nearly eighty eight years old.
> The Clark, Campbell, McKown, and other Scotch families were added to the settlement in time, which extended itself northward and into Tate.
> Almost without exception the descendants of the above have become among the most useful citizens of the township, distinguished for their industry, intelligence, and integrity.
> Their well-kept farms, fine buildings, and improved stock have given the settlement a merited reputation and words of praise from all who visit that part of the county, which is one of the
most desirable in all Clermont.
