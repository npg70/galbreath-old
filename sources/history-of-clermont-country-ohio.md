> This is the oldest village in the township, and was for

> And the third and last
> recorded addition was made by **James Galbreath**, James
> Forsythe, and Thomas W. Hale, Oct. 14, 1817.  It con-

No other Kintyre-sounding names mentioned except:

> Crawford, but the precise time cannot be determined; prob-
> ably soon after the village was laid out.
