Extensive notes on [John Galbraith](/people/galbraith-john-1809.md), founder of Scotia Distillery and Provost of Campbeltown 1860-66:

> His Galbraith family was not of native Kintyre stock, 
> but descended from 17th century Lowland settlers. John's
> parents were Archibald Galbraith, merchant, and Jean
> Corbet. His grandfather, Archibald Galbraith, was a
> merchant in Campbeltown, and his great-grandfather,
> William, was a maltster. Each of these, like his father,
> married into a Plantation family: Langwill and Dunlop,
> respectively. John's bother William, a merchant in Campbeltown,
> was a partner in Stewart, Galbraith & co. from its foundation
> until his death in 1883. His other brothers, Archibald and Andrew,
> who left Kintyre, were cotton-spinners amd merchants, and
> Andrew was Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1857 until 1860.
>
> His widow, Mary Coville McEwing, was aged 82 when she died
> in 1900. Her parents were John Townley McEwing, R.N., and 
> Elizabeth Colville. For daughter Elizabeth...

Possible error for William's death.  This has 1883.  But may be 1863.

> James Greenlees, farmer, and Catherine Galbraith. There were

> James Greenlees, farmer, Peninver' -- died at Moy [farm],
