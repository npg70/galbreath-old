Unfortunately, not so much on Galbraith.  The index lists three entries, which point to a transcription of Hearth Tax records from 1666-1669,
mostly under the name _McBritany_.  No expository text.

The appendixes, which are not indexed, have some other facts:

"Appendix 1: Alphabetical list of the family names of the Glens of Antrim, taken from the Electoral Register for 1963" mentions  "Galbraiths: 9"

"Appendix 3: Most numerous family names in south-west Argyll and Arran"

* Kintyre, Electorate 2691,Including Gigha, excluding Campbeltown:   Galbraith #5 with 48
* Campebeltown, Electorate 4372:  Galbraith #18 with 50

Arran, Colonsay, Islay and Jura did not have Galbraith listed.
