Archibald and the ship is listed in [Clyde Ships](http://clydeships.co.uk/view.php?ref=4172), and gives his address as "Carradale".

It appears the holding company was "Ocean Shells", and the director was "Alexander Archibald Galbraith", born in Oct 1945, according to [Check Company](http://www.checkcompany.co.uk/director/6130352/ALEXANDER-ARCHIBALD-GALBRAITH)

Looks like Archibald was part of rescue operation, [Scotland's Cruel Sea](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Scotland_s_Cruel_Sea/eX8vBgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%20Galbraith)

Maybe the son of  [Alexander Galbraith b. 1915](/people/galbraith-alexander-1915-mcdougal.md)
