Archibald and the ship is listed in [Clyde Ships](http://clydeships.co.uk/view.php?ref=4172), and gives his address as "Carradale".

It appears the holding company was "Ocean Shells", and the director was "Alexander Archibald Galbraith", born in Oct 1945, according to [Check Company](http://www.checkcompany.co.uk/director/6130352/ALEXANDER-ARCHIBALD-GALBRAITH)

Looks like Archibald was part of rescue operation, [Scotland's Cruel Sea](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Scotland_s_Cruel_Sea/eX8vBgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=Archibald%20Galbraith,%20Carradale)

Poking around some more, a [Ancestry.com](https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/alexander-galbraith-24-m66cxh) page says


> Born in Saddell, Argyllshire on 19 Mar 1887 to Alexander Galbraith and Mary Campbell. 
> Alexander Galbraith married Eliza Tina Campbell and had 3 children. He passed away on 1966 in Carradale, Argyll, Scotland.

A random record on Ancestry.com page lists the children as:

1. John Colin Campbell Galbraith, 1910 - 1988
2. Alexander Galbraith, 1914-2000
4. Richard Harris Galbraith 1918 - 1995
