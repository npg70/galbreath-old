An 18th Century Letter from Campbeltown to America

> a number of family letters sent to Mr. Alexr. Galbreath, 3 miles west from 
> Slateridge Meeting House, near Peachbottom Ferry, York County, Merryland

That's [Alexander Galbreath](/people/galbreath-alexander-1753.md) of York County, _Pennslyvania_.

> The writer of the letter William Ker was the Overseer or Manager of the Coal Mine....
>
> The following letter is from Knochrioch, 21st July, 1791, and Wm. Ker whose wife is Galbraith is
> a brother-in-law of Alexander Galbraith to whom it is addressed.

Note: spelling changed from Galbreath to Galbraith.

This would be a sister of Alexander who married a William Ker/Kerr. There is a sister Mary, but found
no marriage. 

Given that Alexander's family was part of the Long Row Relief Church, it's possible records are held there.

> The small pox... My young ones which consists of 2 boys by my last marriage has both had 
> it the youngest who is now 54 weeks old is just recovering.

Two boys John (1788) and Charles (1790, https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/view-image/nrs_opr_records/433628?image=122&return_row=1) matches.
THe birth for Charles says "oversear for Knockrioch".  So this is William.


So if "my last marriage" may mean not "previous" but "most recent".  Still no evidnece of a Galbraith marriage.

> I seed [saw] your father and stepmother a day or two ago...

A stepmother... that's new. There is some confusion over his mother Agnes who signed her name as Janet in another set of letters.
