An 18th Century Letter from Campbeltown to America

> a number of family letters sent to Mr. Alexr. Galbreath, 3 miles west from 
> Slateridge Meeting House, near Peachbottom Ferry, York County, Merryland

That's Alexander Galbreath of York County, _Pennslyvania_.

> The writer of the letter William Ker was the Overseer or Manager of the Coal Mine....
>
> The following letter is from Knochrioch, 21st July, 1791, and Wm. Ker whose wife is Galbraith is
> a brother-in-law of Alexander Galbraith to whom it is addressed.

Note: spelling changed from Galbreath to Galbraith.

This would be a sister of Alexander who married a William Ker/Kerr.  There is a sister Mary, but found
no marriage. 

Given that Alexander's family was part of hte Long Row Relief Church, it's possible records are held there.

> The small pox... My young ones which consists of 2 boys by my last marriage has both had 
> it the youngest who is now 54 weeks old is just recovering.

The sentence is a bit confused, but one was born in 1790, by perhaps another mother.  Boom:

    KERR
    CHARLES
    WILLIAM KERR/MARGARET MACNEILL FR745 (FR745)
    M
    13/07/1790
    507/
    20 122
    Campbeltown
    
This William Kerr, https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/LY9F-2FP had another younger boy John b. 1788, and continued to have children until 1805.

    KERR
    WILLIAM
    MARGARET MCNEILL/FR1382 (FR1382)
    25/01/1788
    507/
    50 23
    Campbeltown

So if "my last marriage" may mean not "previous" but "most recent".  Still no evidnece of a Galbraith marriage.

> I seed [saw] your father and stepmother a day or two ago...

A stepmother... that's new.  There is some confusion over his mother Agnes who signed her name as Janet in another set of letters.
