William Fleming https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/9HV9-6YJ

> William is William Fleming, referred to in the note above, and
> his partner was Archibald Galbreath 'that farmer in Skerrling', which looks
> as though it could be a form of 'Skeroblin'; but if so, there is no record of a 
> Galbreath/Galbraith tenant there. In a letter William wrote in July of the following
> year to his father-in-law in Illinois, he reported that he and Galbreath
> had taken then 'leddils of the Burrugh' at a rent of 230 and that their contact
> would expire on 1 September, but 'it is not appearing to pay well on account of
> a defincancy [deficiency] in the crop and prices being very low.'
