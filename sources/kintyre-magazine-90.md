Letter 1849/1850, page 17, note 11

William Fleming https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/9HV9-6YJ

> William is William Fleming, referred to in the note above, and
> his partner was Archibald Galbreath 'that farmer in Skerrling', which looks
> as though it could be a form of 'Skeroblin'; but if so, there is no record of a 
> Galbreath/Galbraith tenant there. In a letter William wrote in July of the following
> year to his father-in-law in Illinois, he reported that he and Galbreath
> had taken then 'leddils of the Burrugh' at a rent of 230 and that their contact
> would expire on 1 September, but 'it is not appearing to pay well on account of
> a defincancy [deficiency] in the crop and prices being very low.'

This appears to be [Archibald Galbreath](/people/galbreath-archibald-1803.md), born 8 Sep 1803, Skerbolin Farm, the oldest son of James Galbreath and Martha Galbreath. The origin of the parents is unknown, but they were married in Campbeltown in 1800, and between 1801 and 1821 had 11 children, all of whom have Old Parish Records in Campbeltown saying the father was a "Farmer Skerbolin". While James and Martha could be related, we do know there were at least three different genetic lines (i.e. shared no ancestors for at least 500 years) of Galbraiths/Galbreaths living in Campbeltown at this time. It is suspected James died prior to 1841 due to lack of records in the 1841 census.

Archibald however is in the 1841 census as a farmer in Ugdale. [[ Is this close to Skerbolin? As the oldest son, would he gain the family farm?? ]] It would appear the letters in 1849 foreshadowed a career change. Starting with the 1851 Census, Archibald is now listed as a Flesher (butcher). He died 17 Feb 1885 in Campbeltown (also listed as a flesher).

He married first in Campbeltown 5 Mar 1835 to Eugina McCallum. They had two children, but Eugina appears to have died due to complications of childbirth. He married again at Southend 25 Aug 1839 (with a second ceremony a year later at Campbeltown 25 Aug 1850) to Margaret Loynachan. They had eight children. It is suspected there are living descendants.
