> The Greenlees family came to Kintyre in about 1640, when a miller of that name 
> moved from Lochwinnoch (Renfrewshire) to Southend. In 1810, James Greenlees,
> farmer at Peninver (north of Campbeltown), married Catherine Galbreath. Peninver
> was the farm originally worked by Catherine's father, Samuel Galbreath.
> The couple had 11 children, the first born son (b. 1812) being named Samuel,
> after James's father. James died in 1850 leaving 
> £186 18s 7 d, of which £137 18s 9d represented cattle, horses and farm implements.
